# Honoured to present our technology to HRH Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark

We were honoured to present our wave energy technology to HRH Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark on 20 June at DMEC (Dutch Marine Energy Centre).

HRH Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark was accompanied by Christian Stenberg, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities and the Danish Ambassador in the Netherlands Jarl Frijs-Madsen.

We are pleased with the Danish interest in our technology as Denmark is one of the leading countries in wave energy technologies. Much we can learn from each other to make wave energy a significant part of the energy transition.

Special thanks to Embassy of Denmark in the Netherlands and The Hague Business Agency
