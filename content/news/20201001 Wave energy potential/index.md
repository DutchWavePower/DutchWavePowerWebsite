# Wave potential

{{< image potential_cropped  right 50 >}}
We are confident we found a way to unlock the enormous wave energy potential. Unfortunately we cannot share the concept with you yet as we are awaiting the patent application. However, we would like to share some facts & figures about wave energy:

- For Europe, it is expected that 10% of total electricity production will come from wave energy by 2050. This is 350,000 GWh per year and covers more than 90 million households.

- For the Netherlands this will be 2% or 2000 GWh per year, because the North Sea has a relatively low energy density. But the accessibility of this sea and the infrastructure that is already present due to the construction of wind farms, makes this a very interesting sea for the development of wave energy converters and especially ours!
