title: Accelerating Offshore Energy Transition Netherlands and Flanders launch OFFSHORE FOR SURE Project!
weight: 0
summary: |-
 In the coming years, renewable energy at sea will receive a significant boost. Fifteen partners from Flanders and the Netherlands are pooling their expertise in the Offshore For Sure project to test five promising energy solutions and enhance their applicability in the energy system. The project's objective is to accelerate the energy transition at sea and drive the sustainable blue economy in collaboration with knowledge institutions, regional, and societal organizations. The Interreg Flanders-Netherlands program for 2021-2027 supports this collaboration.

# Accelerating Offshore Energy Transition, Netherlands and Flanders launch OFFSHORE FOR SURE Project!!
During the three-year duration of the project, the project partners will invest more than 10
million euros in the Flemish-Dutch border region. This investment is made possible in part
by the European Interreg Flanders-Netherlands program and co-financiers. The
consortium believes that these offshore energy solutions will contribute to a smarter,
greener, and more co-operative Europe. BLUESPRING is the initiator behind the Offshore
For Sure project idea and acts as the project coordinator.

Five Innovations and Supporting Partners
The five demonstration projects represent innovative solutions from technology developers
with a proven track record and a clear plan for deployment in the fields of tidal energy,
wave energy, offshore floating solar energy, and energy storage:
1. Wave energy from Dutch Wave Power
2. Tidal energy from Water2Energy Projects
3. Offshore solar from Oceans of Energy
4. Energy storage simulation from FLASC
5. Smart asset management and predictive maintenance of tidal turbines from Tocardo
For their developments, the technology developers can rely on the knowledge and
expertise of partners Bluespring, World Class Maintenance, International Marine; Dredging
Consultants, Ecopower, Rijkswaterstaat, Parkwind, Ghent University, HOWEST,
Deftiq, and the Zeeland Environmental Federation.
Collaboration Focused on Three Domains
Activities in the project have strong ties to the regions where they are conducted and have
both local and international impact. Therefore, we are developing various services to
maximize the gained experience and apply it internationally.

Policy & Public Engagement
As a significant portion of the developments take place at sea, outside the view of
residents and their living environment, we involve communities in the projects, exchange
knowledge, and thereby increase support and awareness. We work closely with nature
and environmental organizations, cooperatives, and similar projects.
Education
We are developing learning trajectories, including online and hybrid courses, based on the
knowledge acquired during the project's implementation. We promote student exchange
and establish collaboration between educational partners in Flanders and the Netherlands.
Certification
We are working on certification services for testing in laboratories and at sea to ensure the
efficiency and robustness of the developed systems.


Sustainable Perspective
The yield of our offshore energy transition is assessed by three types of end users:
governments, project developers, and citizen cooperatives. Through their approval of our
business cases, we attract further investments for both technology and projects. This
should lead to bankable projects for the future, contributing to economic growth in the
region and creating new jobs in the sustainable blue economy.

{{< image Pressrelease-Eng_O4S >}}

OFFSHORE FOR SURE receives funding from the Interreg Flanders-Netherlands
2021-2027 program VI, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund under
subsidy contract number Int6B015. Additionally, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the
Netherlands, the Dutch provinces of Zeeland, North Brabant, and South Holland, as well
as the Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO) and the province of
East Flanders provide financial support.
About INTERREG FLANDERS-NETHERLANDS:
Interreg Flanders-Netherlands subsidizes projects with shared borders for smart, green,
and inclusive growth. Interreg Flanders-Netherlands has received over 205 million euros
from the European Regional Development Fund (EFRO) to invest in valuable projects
between 2021 and 2027.

About the Partners:
● BLUESPRING: BLUESPRING has extensive experience in managing complex,
long-term international collaboration projects in the field of offshore renewable
energy, with a specialization in certification.
● Parkwind N.V. (PWD): Parkwind N.V. is a green energy company that develops,
finances, and operates offshore wind farms. With over ten years of experience and
771 megawatts under operational management, Parkwind has four operational wind
farms in Belgium and is currently developing the Arcadis Ost I project in Germany
(257 MW).
● Ecopower (BE): Ecopower, a citizen cooperative, has been dedicated to building a
democratic, decentralized, and sustainable energy system through citizen
participation for over 30 years. With 67,000 cooperative members and 55,000
customers, Ecopower has invested over 100 million euros in wind, solar,
sustainable heat, and hydropower projects.
● Rijkswaterstaat Offshore Expertise Centre (RWS): Rijkswaterstaat Offshore
Expertise Centre provides platforms at wind farms in the North Sea with sensors to
collect a wide variety of data. These sensors contribute to monitoring marine
ecosystems and maritime safety and cybersecurity.
● Dutch Wave Power: Dutch Wave Power develops a point absorber wave energy
converter and has extensive testing experience at, among others, MARIN and
Deltares. The technology of Dutch Wave Power consists of a floating body with all
energy conversion components completely sealed off from seawater. The floating
body moves with the rotating motion of the waves.
● Water2Energy Projects BV: Water2Energy Projects BV develops a vertical-axis
tidal turbine and has successfully conducted pilots in the Port of Antwerp and the
