# Accelerating Offshore Energy Transition Netherlands and Flanders launch OFFSHORE FOR SURE Project!!
During the three-year duration of the project, the project partners will invest more than 10
million euros in the Flemish-Dutch border region. This investment is made possible in part
by the European Interreg Flanders-Netherlands program and co-financiers. The
consortium believes that these offshore energy solutions will contribute to a smarter,
greener, and more co-operative Europe. BLUESPRING is the initiator behind the Offshore
For Sure project idea and acts as the project coordinator.
