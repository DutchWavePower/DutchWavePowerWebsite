# Milestone Achievement:: Dutch Wave Power receives a positive Technology Appraisal by Stork, a BiLFINGER company!

Dutch Wave Power successfully completed a Technical Qualification Assessment of our innovative wave energy conversion technology. 

This assessment was conducted by Stork and was commissioned by World Class Maintenance, as part of the Offshore For Sure project, a project funded by Interreg Vlaanderen-Nederland
The Stork team provided a comprehensive evaluation/assessment according to the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) TC 62600-4 Specification for establishing qualification of new technology covering::

* Technology definition:: A detailed asset breakdown structure of the system
* Qualification bases:: criteria for success and reliability of the technology
* Technology assessment:: In-depth analysis of capabilities and uncertainties
* Threat/Risk assessment:: Identification and mitigation of potential risks by extensive FMECA and RAM analysis

We express sincere gratitude to the Stork team:: Ludolf Pijpker, Nina Fozein Kwanke and Sebastiaan Soerel for their expertise and dedication throughout this process. 

Also we want to express our appreciation to World Class Maintenance and Bluespring for initiating and managing this Technical Qualification process.
This successful assessment marks a significant milestone for Dutch Wave Power:: one step closer to bringing clean, reliable wave energy to the world!
